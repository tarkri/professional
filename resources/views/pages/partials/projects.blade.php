                <p>Stagen is exists to help businesses be a force for good. I help them teach and train leaders via their Stagen Online Portal, which houses their mindfully curated and produced learning materials and practices. My role as design technologist at COLOSSAL was to help transition and improve Stagen’s complex and robust analog teaching material in the digital world. I now develop even more robust internal apps and platforms for them interact with their students and team members. </p>
